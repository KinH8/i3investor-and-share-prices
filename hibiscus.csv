2022-08-18 20:32:52.349291,VTrade," Hibiscus selling crude oil from Labuan, under Wilayah Persekutuan. In such the case, why should hibiscus paying the Sabah state government tax?     Hibiscus should pay Sabah state tax if crude oil selling through Kota Kinabalu or any location under The Sabah.     Even if Hibiscus paying the Sabah State tax, it is merely peanut to Hibiscus. Hibiscus still earning explosively!     Personally holding near 2 million hibiscus shares, no worry at all. Remember Dr Kenneth Gerard Pereira acquired hibiscus at the share price of 0.90+, with the total amount of direct and indirect shares of 180million. Don’t see him panicking, but laughing to bank with the profits. Why should you worry?     I m seeing sour grape here. Laugh out Loud!  ",6

2022-08-19 00:32:52.349291,VTrade," Let me share a bed time story to all of you with the heart of loving kindness again…        There is an old monk in the temple. The temple is on the mountain.     One day, many investors who speculated in stocks came to the temple. At the Bodhisattva, the investors said that the shares fell sharply, and we lost a lot of money, and did not know how to get rid of the suffering.     The old monk has been compassionate to those investors. He bought up the shares and saved those people with the heart of loving kindness.        Many days later, those investors came to the temple to burn incense, and they were all excited, begging the monk to sell the shares to them.   Out of loving kindness, the monk sold the shares to them.     Soon after all the shares in the were sold, and the market fell sharply.        The old monk made a lot of money back and forth, and everyone asked the old monk for advice on share trading.     The monk said: ""I have NO CRAVING for anything is the SECRET! Merely holding a KIND HEART!""       Goodnight! Cheers! ",5
